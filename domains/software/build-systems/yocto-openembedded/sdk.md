# SDK

The SDK is generated by using the image recipe and specifying the `populate_sdk` task.
Here is a list of key variables related to SDK creation in Yocto:
- SDKMACHINE: Specifies the machine architecture for which the SDK is built (e.g., x86_64).
- TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_TASK: Lists packages to install into the target sysroot in the SDK.
- TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK: Lists packages to install into the host sysroot in the SDK.
- SDK_IMAGE_FEATURES: Specifies additional features for the SDK (e.g., dev-pkgs, tools-sdk).
- SDK_TARGETS: Specifies additional targets for the SDK.
- SDKROOT: Specifies the root directory for the SDK installation.
- SDK_OUTPUT: Specifies the output directory for the generated SDK.
- SDK_EXT_TYPE: Specifies the type of extended SDK (e.g., ext for extensible SDK).
- SDK_USE_PREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN: Specifies whether to use a prebuilt toolchain.

Good approach is to add SDK specific settings to the image recipe. Specify sdk specific
packages in the TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_TASK or TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK.
