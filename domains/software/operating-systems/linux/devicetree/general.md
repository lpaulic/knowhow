# Devicetree general
{: .no_toc }

Originally devicetree was part of the Open Firmware project. That is why in the 
Linux kernel the API functions have `*of*` in the function names.

The idea of the devicetree is to specify how the hardware is connected. This 
rule is often bent and a lot of software related configuration is located 
in the device tree as well.
