## Abbreviations
- DNP 
    - "do not place". Type of components that are present in the schematic andPCB
    PCB, but are not mounted during the actual assembly of electronic module. For
    example, connector for connection to another module that is not used in the
    application, pulldown resistor that is probably not necessary but we would
    like to foresee a possibility of having it in the design...
- FFC 
    - flexible flat cable. Flexible cable with multiple conductors used for signal
    and low power transfer. Typical number of conductors in range of 2 to 100,
    typical pitch 0.3-0.5 mm. Typically used for connecting two modules via
    FPC connector.
- FPC
    - can mean "flexible PCB" or type of the corresponding connector.
    For both, see under "Basic electronic components".
- IC
    - integrated circuit
- PCB
    - printed circuit board  
- R
    - resistor
- D
    - diode
- C 
    - capacitor
- L
    - inductor
- T
    - transistor
- U
    - in some CAD tools use to denote ICs
