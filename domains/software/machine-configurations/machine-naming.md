# Machine naming convention

For personal work machines I am naming the macines 
using tree names, i.e.: oak, olive, pine, etc. No specific 
reason other that it sounds good and there are plenty of 
trees so I will not run out of names.

The machine name represents the following machine configurations:
- CPU
- GPU
- OS
- Desktop environemnt

The machine name follows the following template:
```
<profile-name>-<4-digit-SN>
```

Differences in above components differentiate the machine configurations,
if two machines have the same above components they will have the 
same profile name name. Each machine will have its own SN. 

Current machine profiles that I am using or have configured:
- `ginkgo`:
    - CPU: AMD
    - GPU: AMD
    - OS: Arch Linux
    - Desktop environment: Hyprland
- `maple`:
    - CPU: AMD
    - GPU: AMD + NVIDIA
    - OS: Arch Linux
    - Desktop environemnt: Hyprland
