# Software knowhow
Repository for software knowhow gathered throguh the years.

## Getting around
The repository is intended to be an overview of knowledge specific for 
software engineering in Linux and Embedded Linux. This repository was not 
maintained from the beginning of my work experience so some things that I've 
have experience in is not documente, but they will be added when and if 
I need to use that knowledge again.

The idea for this repository is to contain templates, knowledge, book notes,
etc.

If there is wrong info let me know through issue reports. I will fix all the 
mistakes or missing info.
